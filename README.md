## Synopsis

Let's Map the World

A real time application. 


## Motivation

I was wondering where are people on the Internet. First, I made this project with PHP (it was the first server-side langage I learned). It didn't work in real time very well. I heard about websocket and event's programming with nodeJs. So here is the project ! 

## Installation

On a server, simply launch : `
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tofull/LetsMapTheWorld
cd LetsMapTheWorld/
npm install 
npm start
```

## Tests
This app is working on : https://letsmaptheworld.herokuapp.com/
