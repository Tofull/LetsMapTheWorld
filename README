## Synopsis

Let's Map the World

A real time application. 


## Motivation

I wonder where are people on the Internet. First, I made this project with PHP (it was the first server-side langage I learned). It didn't work in real time very well. I heard about websocket and event's programming with nodeJs. So here the project ! 

## Installation

On a server, simply launch : npm install 

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
